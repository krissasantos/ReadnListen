JAVASCRIPT PROJECT MODE
That's right - Project Mode is back! For this project, you'll work in teams to build a JavaScript app that will hit API and use the data in an interesting way. You can use one or more APIs in this project.
You'll follow the object-oriented design patterns we've been showing in lectures this week (models, controllers, adapter, store). You're free to use jQuery, and you can make your app one or more pages.
With your team, start brainstorming possible ideas and looking for APIs you might want to use. One you have an idea, please get it approved by an instructor before you start coding.
Words of caution - It can be difficult to come up with a very specific idea first and then try to find APIs that can give you the data you need because it might not be available. We recommend coming up with some general ideas and then seeing what types of APIs are out there. Be prepared that APIs can be outdated or have incorrect documentation. Be prepared to ditch your idea and try something new if you find the API you wanted to use isn't working as expected.
EXAMPLES OF PAST PROJECTS:
Movie Reviews - Users can search for a movie and see both IMBD information and movie reviews from NYTimes
"Bomb Sniffer" - Search by actor name and see their top five worst-performing movies at the box office
Use the Yelp and NYC parking API to find parking near highly-rated restaurants
Use Spotify and Bands in Town APIs to show you local concerts based on your Spotify music preferences
Some reliable APIs you might consider using:
Github
New York Times
Spotify
Twitter
NYC Open data
Yelp
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
At least one API call
A store to hold the data
Three models with at least one has-many, belongs-to relationship
At least one controller
An adapter function to make the API call and parse the data
